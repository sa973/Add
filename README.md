# Add
This is a web app built using React and Node.js. It allows users to add two numbers and see the steps involved in the addition process. The front-end is in React and the back-end is in Node.js and Express. The server calculates the sum and carry at each step and sends back the result as a JSON object. The code is available on GitHub.
